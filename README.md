# UML Diagrams: Geeky Video Game Store

This repository contains a set of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams designed to model the system of a hypothetical geek-themed video game retail store. These diagrams provide a visual representation of the store's structure, behavior, and relationships between different elements.

## Purpose

The purpose of these diagrams is to:

*   Visually represent the different components of the store's system (e.g., inventory, customers, sales).
*   Illustrate the interactions and relationships between these components.
*   Provide a blueprint for potential software development or system improvements.
*   Serve as documentation for understanding the store's operational flow.

## Diagrams Included

This repository includes the following UML diagrams:

*   **Use Case Diagram:** Illustrates the various actors (customers, employees) and their interactions with the system.
*   **Class Diagram:** Depicts the classes (objects) within the system and their attributes and relationships (e.g., Product, Customer, Order).
*   **Activity Diagram:** Shows the flow of activities for specific processes within the store (e.g., processing a sale, restocking inventory).
*   **Sequence Diagram:** Visualizes the interactions between different objects in a specific scenario (e.g., a customer placing an order).
*   **(Optional) State Diagram:** (If applicable) Illustrates the different states an object can be in and the transitions between them.
*   **(Optional) Component Diagram:** (If applicable) Shows the organization and dependencies between software components.

## Files

The diagrams are provided in the following format:

*   **Formats:** .pdf (Portable Document Format), .mdj (StarUML Project File), .brM3 (BRModelo File).

## How to View/Use the Diagrams

To view the diagrams, you will need:

*   **.pdf files:** A PDF viewer (e.g. Adobe Acrobat Reader).
*   **.mdj files:** StarUML (available at: https://staruml.io/) or a compatible UML modeling tool that supports the StarUML project file format (.mdj).
*   **.brM3 files:** BRModelo (available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/brmodelo/) to view and work with these files.

You can use these diagrams for:

*   Studying the structure and behavior of a retail store system.
*   Designing or improving a similar system.
*   Learning UML modeling techniques.
*   Illustrating a case study.
